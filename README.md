Motivation:

1. Is it possible to infer the persons goals by analyzing their
eye fixations?
2. Eye movements can reveal complex cognitive states of mind
3. Analyse Visual Behavior
4. Closed World Vs Open World Settings
5. Prediction of Search Targets using Stationary Eye Tracker

**Hardware**
Mobile eye tracker

**Data**

* Data collected from ~18 participants
* Virtual objects

**Data Preprocessing**

* Implemented computer vision algorithms to preprocess data

**Feature extraction**

* Used pre-trained network like resNet-50 to extract features from data

**Approaches**

* Implemented various Machine learning/Deep Learning algorithms to predict the search target
